                <h2>IP Addresses, Packets and Routing</h2>
                <p>What are IP Addresses and what is their purpose? An IP Address is an Internet Protocol address which is a numerical assigned to each
                    device connected to a network that uses the internet. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification
                    and location addressing. When downloading data or information from a website, the IP address helps the website know where to actually send
                    that information otherwise it would be impossible to send anything.  </p>
                <p>During the early days of the internet, there was no standard in packet sending or receiving. Internet Protocol (IP) was developed by
                    Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. They collaborated on the design of software known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or
                    TCP/IP that implements the architecture. The two believe the internet would be better if it was standardized with uniform protocol to establish a
                    commonality to effectively communicate. Since protocols are basically a set of rules agreed on by both parties, they can be used on the internet
                    for the transfer of information as both sides of a data transfer understand protocol.  </p>
                <p>When you hear IP address, you may have heard IPv4 or IPv6 in the conversation. This is essential the version of the IP address. Traditional IPv4
                    addresses are 32 bit long and it defines both network and host address and has around 4 billion combinations of IPs which was believed to never be
                    reached. However, with the emergence of the smart phones and devices that number was rapidly approaching which led to the adoption of IPv6 which is
                    an IP addressing schema that uses 128 bits per address made up of 8 segments of 4 hexadecimal characters.</p>
                <p>Data transfers on the internet are not direct but actually very indirect. Paths can change constantly, even during a transfer of data. When sending
                    a large file on the internet, the file could be broken up into a number of packets depending on how large the file is. </p>
                <p>A packet is a piece of data that travels on the internet and it has the IP address of where it came from and the IP address of where it
                    is being sent. Packets are data traveling along the internet and work more like cars than trains. Special computers on the internet called
                    routers help direct each packet to reach their destination in the quickest route at the time. The route that each packet takes could be the same
                    or a completely different than the other packets being sent with it, since the internet is a constantly changing web of connections being established
                    or dissolved, routers are a fundamental reason why the internet is so reliable. </p>
